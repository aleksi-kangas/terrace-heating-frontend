# Terrace Heating Frontend
> A React.js frontend which enables monitoring and controlling of a terrace heating system.

A personal project for gaining a deeper understanding of Full Stack development
by building a meaningful application for real world use.

In a nutshell, this project enables monitoring and controlling the heating system for an enclosed terrace at my parents' home.

#### Background Motivation
At my parents' home, there is an enclosed terrace for which the heating (ground & air) is provided by a *Lämpöässä* ground source heat-pump.

As I found that monitoring and controlling the heat-pump was a bit cumbersome through the provided cloud platform,
I visioned about a simple and responsive web application which would provide my family members an easy way of using the terrace heating system.

This repository contains the implementation of the frontend portion of the application.
